<p>Getting back into good habits, and entering the world of AI.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is great to be back! It feels like ages since I last wrote here. These past few years have been full of intense work, stressing deadlines, and <strong>a clear neglect for this newsletter</strong>. However, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that I&rsquo;ve completely stopped writing. Actually, last year has been <strong>the year that I&rsquo;ve written the most in my life.</strong></p>
<p>Let me explain you why&hellip;</p>
<p><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F576db18d-971d-47e8-b8c2-4528204ee0f0_1152x896.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="my-personal-journal">My personal Journal</h2>
<p>It was the 28th of December of 2022. Every year on the same day, I sit down at home, I put on good music, and I spend an hour or two reflecting on the past year. I&rsquo;ve been doing this since my last year of college, and so far it has worked like a charm for me. I use this time to think about all my achievements and failures of the year both, personally and professionally. In the process, I think of ways to make my next year even better. I design my goals and habits, and I try to my system.</p>
<p>That day on 2022 one of the things I realized is that I was having a really hard time remembering all the things that have happened the past year. I felt like I had been on autopilot all year, and I wasn&rsquo;t spending as much time thinking about random stuff as in previous years. <strong>My solution to this? Starting a personal journal. This was one of my main 2023 resolutions.</strong></p>
<p>Since then, every night from the 1st of January of 2023 I&rsquo;ve written (actually, handwritten) several hundred words a day with ideas, the highlights of my day, or whatever I was in the mood of writing that day. This exercise was great to let my mind wander for a bit every day <strong>fostering my creativity, and incidentally taking better track of all of the highlights of the year.</strong></p>
<p>So now you know why I say that 2023 has been the year that I&rsquo;ve written the most ever.</p>
<h2 id="my-website">My website</h2>
<p>On this year&rsquo;s (2023 edition) reflection exercise, I saw that there was a recurring theme I kept writing about on my diary: <strong>I missed sharing my writings and all of my learning with a broader audience than myself</strong>.</p>
<p>To kill the itch, I repurposed my <a href="https://www.adlrocha.com/">personal website</a> and started using it as my technical journal. I created a &ldquo;TIL&rdquo; (Today I Learned) section to write down interesting things that I may have come across in my daily work, and a standard &ldquo;All posts&rdquo; section with more long-formed and worked writings.`</p>
<p>I ended up writing less than I would&rsquo;ve hoped for due to a lack of time. Moreover, no one was aware of its existence because I wasn&rsquo;t widely advertising it, so no one was reading it. <strong>But at least now I had a public space where I could start quickly writing ideas in case I wanted to share them in the future.</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7db2f049-4145-478f-a9c9-48af9d997b5f_1676x1041.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="this-newsletter">This newsletter&hellip;</h2>
<p>Another recurring topic that kept appearing on my journal in 2023 was how I missed coming up with lots of ideas, and learning something new every week. Funnily, <strong>the sole responsible for that habit was this newsletter.</strong> The moment I stopped writing here I lost that habit. The fact that I had to write a new publication every week meant that I had to either come up with ideas, or read about some topic and understand it deeply enough to be able to write about it. <strong>It was clear to me that I had to write in this newsletter again whatever it took.</strong></p>
<p>So here I am again. This year I want to prioritize my learning around the field of AI. I feel that a lot has happened in the past year, and I have just been following it from the side. The newsletter can be a good excuse to start get up to speed with the new developments in the field.</p>
<h2 id="-and-a-new-format">&hellip; and a new format.</h2>
<p>The only thing that will change from the previous version of the newsletter is that instead of writing a new publication weekly, I will do it bi-weekly (to give myself some space to think and research new topics).</p>
<p>The other thing that will change is that instead of writing long-form publications directly in Substack, <strong>I will collect of all my writings (and interesting references) of the the two weeks window between posts and directly share them here.</strong> This will make the emails that you receive smaller and (hopefully) easier to consume. In any case, I am open to feedback and I am planning to iterate as I ramp up.</p>
<h2 id="heading">🎁</h2>
<p>And if you&rsquo;ve manage to get this far, I wanted to leave you with a treat. <strong>My first publication of 2024</strong> 🚀</p>

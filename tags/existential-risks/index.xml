      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;8000-hours-positive-impact-jobs&#34;&gt;8,000 hours: Positive impact jobs&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am genuinely worried about the existential risk that AI may pose to humanity in the next decade. Some people take this as a unreal threat inherited from science fiction movies, but I beg to differ. I have studied AI fundamentals when I was in college, and I even ended up doing AI professionally a decade ago for a few months (when LLMs weren&amp;rsquo;t a thing, the transformer paper had just been published, and random forest was still winning Kaggle competitions). Sadly, I don&amp;rsquo;t think I have the required background to contribute to this problem in any way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

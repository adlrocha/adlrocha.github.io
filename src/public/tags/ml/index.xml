      <description>Running LLMs and ML in Wasm  Searching new runtimes for AI
 I came up with an (obvious) idea the other day that led to me to the following question: &amp;ldquo;would it be possible to run LLM inference from Wasm?&amp;quot;. Being able to compile ML models into Wasm would allow us to run them in a heterogeneous set of runtimes and devices, including mobile or the browser. However, would running these models in Wasm offer access to the low-level computational resources of the device required for an efficient execution?</description>

      <description>Late Arrival to the Fuss of LLMs  From zero to zero-point-one in a few resources
 After spending some time reading about the state of AI at a high-level, it was time to dive into the details. For obvious reasons, I decided LLMs were a good first-stop for my AI enlightenment. What are LLMs and how they work (because apparently the why is still a burning open question)?.
Rivers of digital ink have been spilled lately with gentle introductions and deep illustrations of how LLMs and their underlying transformer architectures work.</description>

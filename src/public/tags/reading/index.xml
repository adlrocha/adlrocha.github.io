      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;june-2023-ai-related-reading-list&#34;&gt;June 2023 AI-related Reading List&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I just found myself with a few dozens of tabs opened with AI-related resources that I wanted to read. I feel that having them in &lt;em&gt;RAM&lt;/em&gt; (i.e. opened in my browser) was starting overwhelm me, as I felt I could never find the time to read them (leading to a really uncomfortable feeling while I had to make progress in my day-to-day job). Hence, I decided to periodically move from &lt;em&gt;RAM&lt;/em&gt; to a &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;persistent storage&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; my reading lists so that I could pick them up once I have some time for them (and in the process share them with others that my be interested).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Here’s what’s new: • A new MCP server that lets LLMs query Baselight using natural language • Fresh,
high-quality onchain data across 10+ EVM chains (and growing) • Streamlined charting UX with new
chart types • Public profile pages to showcase your Baselight activity • A clear roadmap to make
structured data more accessible for everyone

Our mission is to break down barriers to structured data and make it usable, trustworthy, and
composable for AI builders, researchers, analysts, and anyone who needs better data.

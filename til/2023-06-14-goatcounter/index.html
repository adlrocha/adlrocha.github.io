  <meta name="description" content="Before joining Protocol Labs as a Research Engineer, I worked as a blockchain expert at Telefónica R&amp;D, where I was responsible for the design and development of core technology based on blockchains, distributed systems, and advanced cryptography. My involvement in research and development began at Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, where I worked on topics related to energy efficiency in data centers. My R&amp;D experience also includes research into the compression efficiency of video coding standards at Ericsson Research and projects related to securing interdomain routing protocols at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. I am also an avid reader and basketball lover.">

<p>I was trying to find an analytics system that was open-source, that respected privacy as much as possible, and that was easy to set up. Suprisingly, I was able to find one after the first search without having to navigate several blog posts or Twitter threads with <em>&ldquo;the best analytics tools you should really now about in 2023&rdquo;</em>.</p>
<p>As their website states, <a href="https://www.goatcounter.com/">GoatCounter</a> <em>&ldquo;is an open source web analytics platform available as a free donation-supported hosted service or self-hosted app. It aims to offer easy to use and meaningful privacy-friendly web analytics as an alternative to Google Analytics or Matomo.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Setting it up in this same website has been as easy as signing up, and copying a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> directive into the header of my site generator.</p>

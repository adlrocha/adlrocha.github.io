      <description>The Current State of AI  Or rather, my limited view from the outside.
 I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to stay up to date (at least at a high level) with all the new developments in the field of AI, but with my full-time job it has been quite a challenge. This can be even more of a challenge when your full-time job is not closely related with the field of AI.</description>

      <description>8,000 hours: Positive impact jobs I am genuinely worried about the existential risk that AI may pose to humanity in the next decade. Some people take this as a unreal threat inherited from science fiction movies, but I beg to differ.

      <description>June 2023 AI-related Reading List I just found myself with a few dozens of tabs opened with AI-related resources that I wanted to read. I feel that having them in RAM (i.e. opened in my browser) was starting overwhelm me, as I felt I could never find the time to read them (leading to a really uncomfortable feeling while I had to make progress in my day-to-day job). Hence, I decided to periodically move from RAM to a &amp;ldquo;persistent storage&amp;rdquo; my reading lists so that I could pick them up once I have some time for them (and in the process share them with others that my be interested).</description>

    <h1 id="reducing-the-size-of-solidity-contracts">Reducing the size of Solidity contracts</h1>
<p>I am currently working on a project that we call <a href="https://ipc.space/">IPC (InterPlanetary Consensus)</a>. We are now implementing the core logic of the protocol in a set of Solidity contracts. Unfortunately, the implementation of one of the contracts of the protocol, the <code>Gateway</code>, was too large to be deployed (over the <code>24KB</code> limit), so we had to figure out ways to reduce its size. <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/tutorials/downsizing-contracts-to-fight-the-contract-size-limit/">This post</a>, is a great introduction of the different approaches to fight the contract size limit. In this quick write-up I will share chronologically how we leveraged each of these approaches to try and make our contract <em>&ldquo;deployable&rdquo;</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/tutorials/downsizing-contracts-to-fight-the-contract-size-limit/#remove-functions">Optimize the code</a>: It may seem like an obvious one, but optimizing the code it can sometimes have a huge impact in the size of the contract. This is the first thing we tried. We removed functions, duplicate code, enabled the compiler&rsquo;s optimizer (yep, we compile with the <code>--via-ir</code> flag), declared custom errors, etc. We definitely reduced the size a lot, but the gateway contract was still to large to be deployed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/tutorials/downsizing-contracts-to-fight-the-contract-size-limit/#separate-your-contracts">Separate the contracts</a>: The second approach we followed was to separate as much of the contract logic as we could into different libraries. But once again, there was a limit in the level of <em>&ldquo;downsizing&rdquo;</em> that we achieved if we wanted a clean separation between libraries and the core logic.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="eip-2535-diamond-contract">EIP-2535: Diamond contract</h2>
<p>At this point we decided to embark ourselves into more complex contract separation architectures. While reading through different solutions and EIPs, we came across this <a href="https://eip2535diamonds.substack.com/p/introduction-to-the-diamond-standard">Introduction to EIP-2553 diamonds</a> that perfectly illustrated what we were after, and I quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted one storage space for all state variables and one Ethereum address from which I could design and implement all functions without bytecode size limitation. And I wanted all functions to read and write to state variables directly, easily and in the same way. It would also be nice to have optional, seemless upgrade functionality: to be able to replace functions, remove them and add new functionality without needing to redeploy everything. To be able to extend the smart contract system in a consistent, systematic way after it is deployed.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seemed like the Diamond pattern was a perfect fit for us. A diamond appears to be a single smart contract with a single Ethereum address. But internally and hidden from the outside it utilizes a set of contracts called facets for its external functions. The following two images depicts the implementation of a diamond under the hood:</p>
<p><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c35c90b-9755-4aea-93fd-58e97f38f32f_554x725.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F796bcd50-8c08-408a-8fb2-45fc044cd5ac_640x360.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Cool, right? And now instead of paraphrasing a lot of the resources we went through for the implementation to explain how they work, let me collect all of these resources and let you navigate them at will.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535">ERC-2535: Diamonds, Multi-Facet Proxy</a></li>
<li>Sample implementation of diamond contracts (<a href="https://github.com/mudgen/diamond-1-hardhat/tree/main">1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mudgen/diamond-2-hardhat/tree/main">2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mudgen/diamond-3-hardhat/tree/main">3</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>I will also leave you here PR where we move from a raw contract to a diamond pattern implementation for reference:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/consensus-shipyard/ipc-solidity-actors/pull/138">IPC subnet actor and gateway diamond implementations PR</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="important-references">Important references</h3>
<p>Finally, here I leave a bunch of interesting resources about Solidity fundamentals that may come handy if you decide to dive deep into the implementation of a diamond contract:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.20/internals/layout_in_storage.html">Understand how storage and state is laid out in contracts</a></li>
<li><a href="https://eip2535diamonds.substack.com/p/understanding-delegatecall-and-how">Understand how delegated calls work</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.20/internals/layout_in_storage.html">Layout of State in Storage variables</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And this one is an interesting consequence you realize after tinkering with the diamond pattern, and is <a href="https://dev.to/mudgen/solidity-libraries-can-t-have-state-variables-oh-yes-they-can-3ke9">that libraries can actually have state</a>, despite what the Solidity docs say :).</p>

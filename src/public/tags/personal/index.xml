      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you the story of how, by chance, &lt;strong&gt;I found myself building a new company with two amazing ex-colleagues.&lt;/strong&gt; As many of you may know by now, I spent the last four years of my career working at Protocol Labs. Throughout this time I had the opportunity to contribute to a lot of exciting projects, learn more than I could have hoped for, and work in the process with incredibly talented and kind human beings. Many of which have ended up becoming really good friends.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;aldrocha---2024-resolutions&#34;&gt;@aldrocha - 2024 Resolutions&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Getting back into good habits, and entering the world of AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is great to be back! It feels like ages since I last wrote here. These past few years have been full of intense work, stressing deadlines, and &lt;strong&gt;a clear neglect for this newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;. However, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that I&amp;rsquo;ve completely stopped writing. Actually, last year has been &lt;strong&gt;the year that I&amp;rsquo;ve written the most in my life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

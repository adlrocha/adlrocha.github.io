      <description>@aldrocha - 2024 Resolutions  Getting back into good habits, and entering the world of AI.
 Is great to be back! It feels like ages since I last wrote here. These past few years have been full of intense work, stressing deadlines, and a clear neglect for this newsletter. However, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that I&amp;rsquo;ve completely stopped writing. Actually, last year has been the year that I&amp;rsquo;ve written the most in my life.</description>

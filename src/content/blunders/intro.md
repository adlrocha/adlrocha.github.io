I guess this one is self-explanatory. I regret not having come up with this idea of tracking all of my blunders sooner. The idea is to keep a tracker of all the mistakes or "better decisions" that I could have made through my career. That way I can look back on them the next time I am faced with similar situations. For context, [this post](https://cep.dev/posts/every-infrastructure-decision-i-endorse-or-regret-after-4-years-running-infrastructure-at-a-startup/) gave me the idea.

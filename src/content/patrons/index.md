# Become a sponsor of my work!
I have a lot of ideas, but I don't have the time to develop them. Financial independence will give me the ability to develop the ideas and research I share in this site and in my [newsletter](https://adlrocha.substack.com). If you see my ideas become a reality, become a sponsor of my work. Right now I am only accepting [sponsors for my newsletter](https://adlrocha.substack.com/subscribe), but this will change in the near future. I am also planning to post a public list of my patrons (they diserve part of the recognition for all my work).

## Some of my Patrons
* Coming soon... I need to ask them permission to make them public first.

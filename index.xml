      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;baselight-letters-volume-2-anchor-datasets-stars-and-our-goal-to-open-the-platform&#34;&gt;Baselight Letters Volume 2: Anchor datasets, stars, and our goal to open the platform.&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s me again! It is crazy that two weeks have already passed. As promised, here&amp;rsquo;s a rundown of the&#xA;highlights from the past two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;surfacing-high-quality-data-with-stars&#34;&gt;Surfacing high-quality data with stars&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I briefly mentioned in my last letter, two of our main obsessions right now are to make&#xA;high-quality datasets easier to find, and to lower the barriers for users to create their own&#xA;queries and insights. We crossed the 50K datasets mark, and among all of this data we have datasets&#xA;of disparate quality. We want users to be able to identify at first glance the most valuable&#xA;datasets without them having to go one-by-one inspecting the data and figuring out if it is what&#xA;they need for their insight.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Fix ERR_NETWORK_CHANGED</title>
      <link>/til/2025-09-01-err-net-changed/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;fix-err_network_changed&#34;&gt;Fix &lt;code&gt;ERR_NETWORK_CHANGED&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This was a pretty annoying issue that I had been facing for months and that it was harming my daily&#xA;productivity to a point that I was considering completely formatting my computer and starting from&#xA;scratch. The issue was the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Every time that I was using an Electron application or I opened a website in my browser that used&#xA;websocket or a persistent communication to a server led to intermitently getting a&#xA;&lt;code&gt;ERR_NETWORK_CHANGED&lt;/code&gt; error. This triggered a restart in the application or website connection.&#xA;For certain applications this was fine, but whenever I was interacting with an LLM or leveraging a&#xA;coding agent with a persistent connection, getting an &lt;code&gt;ERR_NETWORK_CHANGED&lt;/code&gt; error was a major&#xA;setback as it required restarting all the work that it was doing.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I tried everything to debug the problem:&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I first checked if this could be related with the power saving mode for the Wifi card of my&#xA;Framework laptop, but it was still happening when connected through Ethernet.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I disabled my VPNs and reviewed all my firewalls and network policies&amp;hellip; still nothing!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I decided then to directly run &lt;code&gt;sudo journalctl -f -u NetworkManager&lt;/code&gt; to see if I could catch one&#xA;of these events and figure out what was causing the error. And voilá, I found the culprit! The&#xA;error was being triggered by the network manager triggering an event every time a new virtual&#xA;interface was being created. This event was being propagated and picked up by browsers and&#xA;electron applications that were picking up this event as a network change that required a&#xA;reconnection.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I had to know figure out who and why was this virtual interface was being created every minute. I&#xA;inspected my &lt;code&gt;docker events&lt;/code&gt; and the reason was obvious immediately. I was running a few&#xA;containers (mainly Redis) that was running a healthchecks every minute. In order to perform this&#xA;healthcheck, Docker was creating an ephimeral virtual interface that was created and immediately&#xA;destroyed. This is the network event involving my network interfaces that was being picked up by&#xA;the network manager and propagated up.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The issue was simple, I disabled all healthcheck on my containers and it solved the problem. It&#xA;may seem obvious now, but it was a pretty hard one to debug.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also tried to blacklist virtual interfaces in the network manager so the changes triggered by&#xA;healthcheck virtual interfaces are not propagated up, but this ended up not working reliably. It may&#xA;be worth exploring this approach further as it seems cleaner (and more nuclear) but the time I&#xA;time-boxed for this debugging was up and I had to move to something else. I guess this is good&#xA;enough for now, I&amp;rsquo;ll keep you posted if this issue (or something related) ends up surfacing in the&#xA;world again, or if I end up finding the time to debug and find a better fix for it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you the story of how, by chance, &lt;strong&gt;I found myself building a new company with two amazing ex-colleagues.&lt;/strong&gt; As many of you may know by now, I spent the last four years of my career working at Protocol Labs. Throughout this time I had the opportunity to contribute to a lot of exciting projects, learn more than I could have hoped for, and work in the process with incredibly talented and kind human beings. Many of which have ended up becoming really good friends.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I guess this one is self-explanatory. I regret not having come up with this idea of tracking all of my blunders sooner. The idea is to keep a tracker of all the mistakes or &amp;ldquo;better decisions&amp;rdquo; that I could have made through my career. That way I can look back on them the next time I am faced with similar situations. For context, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cep.dev/posts/every-infrastructure-decision-i-endorse-or-regret-after-4-years-running-infrastructure-at-a-startup/&#34;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; gave me the idea.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Running LLMs and ML in Wasm</title>

Being able to compile ML models into Wasm would allow us to run them in a heterogeneous set of runtimes and devices, including mobile or the browser. However, would running these models in Wasm offer access to the low-level computational resources of the device required for an efficient execution?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It is well-known that &lt;strong&gt;depending on the distro and the laptop you use, &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;deep sleep&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; and/or hibernate may not be well-supported&lt;/strong&gt;. This means that even every time that I closed the lid of my laptop, its battery will end up draining until it runs out. This was quite frustrating, because it meant that if I was working on my laptop and closed the lid without remembering to shut down the laptop, I would come back to a laptop without battery.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Late arrival to the fuss of LLMs</title>

For obvious reasons, I decided LLMs were a good first-stop for my AI enlightenment. &lt;strong&gt;What are LLMs and how they work (because apparently the why is still a burning open question)?&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Rivers of digital ink have been spilled lately with gentle introductions and deep illustrations of how LLMs and their underlying transformer architectures work. The good thing about this? There is a lot of information available to learn about them. The bad thing? Filtering the best resources to get you to a good understanding with the lower overhead may be time consuming. Consequently, I decided that instead of writing yet another introductory post about transformers and LLMs, it may be more useful to just share the curated list of resources that have helped me the most on this humble quest. I hope you enjoy it (and if you find any good resource worth including to this list, feel free to send it my way and I&amp;rsquo;ll edit this post).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The model was small enough to test it directly inside Google Colab, as it would fit the 15GiB memory GPUs provided in the free plan.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So without further ado, I opened Google Colab, &lt;code&gt;pip install&lt;/code&gt;ed HF&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;transformers&lt;/code&gt; library, and wrote the following code snippet to test the model:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This can be even more of a challenge when your full-time job is not closely related with the field of AI. My only sources of information these days for all AI-related topics have been Twitter and Hacker News. To make matters worse, my ML background is quite limited and dates back to my college years, so I only understand just half of what I read.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I see you are using it all over the place in this API, but I don&amp;rsquo;t know why&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;. His immediate answer was a bit surprising although kind of expected. He answered, &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I do compiler-driven development, so I don&amp;rsquo;t have a good answer for you&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;. It was kind of an expected answer because after some time writing code in Rust you get used to relying on the compiler for a lot of the heavy-lifting when writing more complex code in order to minimize your cognitive load.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

They want miners to be able to mine new blocks with just a general-purpose CPU, without requiring expensive GPUs or ASICs. And I didn&amp;rsquo;t know that there was already a PoW implementation, originally implemented for Monero, that is optimized for its use in general purpose CPUs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I have studied AI fundamentals when I was in college, and I even ended up doing AI professionally a decade ago for a few months (when LLMs weren&amp;rsquo;t a thing, the transformer paper had just been published, and random forest was still winning Kaggle competitions). Sadly, I don&amp;rsquo;t think I have the required background to contribute to this problem in any way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Reducing the size of Solidity contracts</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;reducing-the-size-of-solidity-contracts&#34;&gt;Reducing the size of Solidity contracts&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am currently working on a project that we call &lt;a href=&#34;https://ipc.space/&#34;&gt;IPC (InterPlanetary Consensus)&lt;/a&gt;. We are now implementing the core logic of the protocol in a set of Solidity contracts. Unfortunately, the implementation of one of the contracts of the protocol, the &lt;code&gt;Gateway&lt;/code&gt;, was too large to be deployed (over the &lt;code&gt;24KB&lt;/code&gt; limit), so we had to figure out ways to reduce its size. &lt;a href=&#34;https://ethereum.org/en/developers/tutorials/downsizing-contracts-to-fight-the-contract-size-limit/&#34;&gt;This post&lt;/a&gt;, is a great introduction of the different approaches to fight the contract size limit. In this quick write-up I will share chronologically how we leveraged each of these approaches to try and make our contract &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;deployable&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;ikea-oriented-development&#34;&gt;Ikea-oriented development&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today I want to share an interesting idea that I feel all software engineers will appreciate in some way (either because they strong agree or disagree): &lt;a href=&#34;https://taylor.town/ikea-oriented-development&#34;&gt;Ikea-oriented development&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The TL;DR idea behind this approach to software engineering is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Packaging is the product: Delivering data is expensive.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Pre-packaged depedencies: If you can’t bundle allen keys for your hex fasteners, stick to screws. Likewise, if you lack the engineering resources to support multiple SDKs, make damn sure your web API is easy enough to access with curl. [&amp;hellip;] My MarioKart 64 cartridge probably won’t inform me that Python2.7 was deprecated. If your program isn’t designed to work 20 years from now, it won’t.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Make experimentation effortless. If tweaking and testing your codebase is a pain, devs will avoid making changes. Nobody wants to wade through spaghetti then wait 40 seconds for recompilation.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Embrace reliable mainstream formats. Use common interfaces like CSV, webhooks, JSON, and RSS. Products are way more useful when you can plug them into GNU utils, IFTTT, Siri Shortcuts, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Write code that can be replaced. Writing code is easy, but editing code is hard. Make inputs and outputs extremely clear; everything between is disposable detail. We intuitively call irreplacable code “complicated” or “spaghetti”.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;why-do-we-need-a-decentralized-internet&#34;&gt;Why do we need a decentralized Internet?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today I had what we could call a crisis of faith. After so many years working in the web3 space, and seeing so much speculation and cool tech solving artificial problems, I was wondering &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;do we really need a new Internet? Or is it just another artificial problem we are creating to have an excuse to attract investment and work in cool tech?&lt;/em&gt;. So I decided to write down a list of reasons why a company or an individual would choose to deploy their applications or services over a decentralized Internet over our current one.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;june-2023-ai-related-reading-list&#34;&gt;June 2023 AI-related Reading List&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I just found myself with a few dozens of tabs opened with AI-related resources that I wanted to read. I feel that having them in &lt;em&gt;RAM&lt;/em&gt; (i.e. opened in my browser) was starting overwhelm me, as I felt I could never find the time to read them (leading to a really uncomfortable feeling while I had to make progress in my day-to-day job). Hence, I decided to periodically move from &lt;em&gt;RAM&lt;/em&gt; to a &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;persistent storage&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; my reading lists so that I could pick them up once I have some time for them (and in the process share them with others that my be interested).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Suprisingly, I was able to find one after the first search without having to navigate several blog posts or Twitter threads with &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;the best analytics tools you should really now about in 2023&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As their website states, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goatcounter.com/&#34;&gt;GoatCounter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;is an open source web analytics platform available as a free donation-supported hosted service or self-hosted app. It aims to offer easy to use and meaningful privacy-friendly web analytics as an alternative to Google Analytics or Matomo.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Financial independence would give me the ability to develop the ideas and research I share in this site and in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://adlrocha.substack.com&#34;&gt;newsletter&lt;/a&gt;. If you see my ideas become a reality, become a sponsor of my work. Right now I am only accepting &lt;a href=&#34;https://adlrocha.substack.com/subscribe&#34;&gt;sponsors for my newsletter&lt;/a&gt;, but this will change in the near future. I am also planning to post a public list of my patrons (they diserve part of the recognition for all my work).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

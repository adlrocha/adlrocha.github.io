      <description>I guess this one is self-explanatory. I regret not have come up with this idea sooner so I had a tracker of all the mistakes or &amp;ldquo;better decisions&amp;rdquo; that I could have made through my career. That way I could look back on them the next time I am faced with similar situations. For context, this post is the one that gave me the idea for this section.</description>

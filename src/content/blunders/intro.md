I guess this one is self-explanatory. I regret not have come up with this idea sooner so I had a tracker of all the mistakes or "better decisions" that I could have made through my career. That way I could look back on them the next time I am faced with similar situations. For context, [this post](https://cep.dev/posts/every-infrastructure-decision-i-endorse-or-regret-after-4-years-running-infrastructure-at-a-startup/) is the one that gave me the idea for this section.

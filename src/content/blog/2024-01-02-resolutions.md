# 2024 Resolutions
> Getting back into good habits, and entering the world of AI.

Is great to be back! It feels like ages since I last wrote here. These past few years have been full of intense work, stressing deadlines, and **a clear neglect for this newsletter**. However, that doesn't mean that I've completely stopped writing. Actually, last year has been **the year that I've written the most in my life.**

Let me explain you why...

## My personal Journal

It was the 28th of December of 2022. Every year on the same day, I sit down at home, I put on good music, and I spend an hour or two reflecting on the past year. I've been doing this since my last year of college, and so far it has worked like a charm for me. I use this time to think about all my achievements and failures of the year both, personally and professionally. In the process, I think of ways to make my next year even better. I design my goals and habits, and I try to my system.

That day on 2022 one of the things I realized is that I was having a really hard time remembering all the things that have happened the past year. I felt like I had been on autopilot all year, and I wasn't spending as much time thinking about random stuff as in previous years. **My solution to this? Starting a personal journal. This was one of my main 2023 resolutions.**

Since then, every night from the 1st of January of 2023 I've written (actually, handwritten) several hundred words a day with ideas, the highlights of my day, or whatever I was in the mood of writing that day. This exercise was great to let my mind wander for a bit every day **fostering my creativity, and incidentally taking better track of all of the highlights of the year.**

So now you know why I say that 2023 has been the year that I've written the most ever.

## My website

On this year's (2023 edition) reflection exercise, I saw that there was a recurring theme I kept writing about on my diary: **I missed sharing my writings and all of my learning with a broader audience than myself**.

To kill the itch, I repurposed my [personal website](https://www.adlrocha.com/) and started using it as my technical journal. I created a "TIL" (Today I Learned) section to write down interesting things that I may have come across in my daily work, and a standard "All posts" section with more long-formed and worked writings.`

I ended up writing less than I would've hoped for due to a lack of time. Moreover, no one was aware of its existence because I wasn't widely advertising it, so no one was reading it. **But at least now I had a public space where I could start quickly writing ideas in case I wanted to share them in the future.**

## This newsletter...

Another recurring topic that kept appearing on my journal in 2023 was how I missed coming up with lots of ideas, and learning something new every week. Funnily, **the sole responsible for that habit was this newsletter.** The moment I stopped writing here I lost that habit. The fact that I had to write a new publication every week meant that I had to either come up with ideas, or read about some topic and understand it deeply enough to be able to write about it. **It was clear to me that I had to write in this newsletter again whatever it took.**

So here I am again. This year I want to prioritize my learning around the field of AI. I feel that a lot has happened in the past year, and I have just been following it from the side. The newsletter can be a good excuse to start get up to speed with the new developments in the field.

## ... and a new format.

The only thing that will change from the previous version of the newsletter is that instead of writing a new publication weekly, I will do it bi-weekly (to give myself some space to think and research new topics).

The other thing that will change is that instead of writing long-form publications directly in Substack, **I will collect of all my writings (and interesting references) of the the two weeks window between posts and directly share them here.** This will make the emails that you receive smaller and (hopefully) easier to consume. In any case, I am open to feedback and I am planning to iterate as I ramp up.

## 🎁

And if you've manage to get this far, I wanted to leave you with a treat. **My first publication of 2024** 🚀

      <description>RandomX: PoW for general-purpose CPUs I was discussing today with the Fluence Labs team and they were describing how they want their Fluence network to be run by a PoW consensus algorithm. They want miners to be able to mine new blocks with just a general-purpose CPU, without requiring expensive GPUs or ASICs. And I didn&amp;rsquo;t know that there was already a PoW implementation, originally implemented for Monero, that is optimized for its use in general purpose CPUs.</description>

      <title>Reducing the size of Solidity contracts</title>

      <description>Reducing the size of Solidity contracts I am currently working on a project that we call IPC (InterPlanetary Consensus). We are now implementing the core logic of the protocol in a set of Solidity contracts. Unfortunately, the implementation of one of the contracts of the protocol, the Gateway, was too large to be deployed (over the 24KB limit), so we had to figure out ways to reduce its size. This post, is a great introduction of the different approaches to fight the contract size limit.</description>

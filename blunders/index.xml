      <description>I guess this one is self-explanatory. I regret not having come up with this idea of tracking all of my blunders sooner. The idea is to keep a tracker of all the mistakes or &amp;ldquo;better decisions&amp;rdquo; that I could have made through my career. That way I can look back on them the next time I am faced with similar situations. For context, this post gave me the idea.</description>

  <meta name="description" content="Co-founder and CTO of Finisterra Labs, where we&#39;re organising the world&#39;s structured data. Before founding Finisterra Labs, I worked at Protocol Labs as a Research Engineer, contributing to open-source projects like libp2p, IPFS, and Filecoin. I also worked as a blockchain expert at Telefónica R&amp;D, where I was responsible for the design and development of core technology based on blockchains, distributed systems, and advanced cryptography. My involvement in research and development began at Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, where I worked on topics related to energy efficiency in data centers. My R&amp;D experience also includes research into the compression efficiency of video coding standards at Ericsson Research and projects related to securing interdomain routing protocols at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. I am also an avid reader and basketball lover.">

  <meta property="og:description" content="Fix ERR_NETWORK_CHANGED This was a pretty annoying issue that I had been facing for months and that it was harming my daily productivity to a point that I was considering completely formatting my computer and starting from scratch. The issue was the following:
Every time that I was using an Electron application or I opened a website in my browser that used websocket or a persistent communication to a server led to intermitently getting a ERR_NETWORK_CHANGED error. This triggered a restart in the application or website connection. For certain applications this was fine, but whenever I was interacting with an LLM or leveraging a coding agent with a persistent connection, getting an ERR_NETWORK_CHANGED error was a major setback as it required restarting all the work that it was doing. I tried everything to debug the problem: I first checked if this could be related with the power saving mode for the Wifi card of my Framework laptop, but it was still happening when connected through Ethernet. I disabled my VPNs and reviewed all my firewalls and network policies… still nothing! I decided then to directly run sudo journalctl -f -u NetworkManager to see if I could catch one of these events and figure out what was causing the error. And voilá, I found the culprit! The error was being triggered by the network manager triggering an event every time a new virtual interface was being created. This event was being propagated and picked up by browsers and electron applications that were picking up this event as a network change that required a reconnection. I had to know figure out who and why was this virtual interface was being created every minute. I inspected my docker events and the reason was obvious immediately. I was running a few containers (mainly Redis) that was running a healthchecks every minute. In order to perform this healthcheck, Docker was creating an ephimeral virtual interface that was created and immediately destroyed. This is the network event involving my network interfaces that was being picked up by the network manager and propagated up. The issue was simple, I disabled all healthcheck on my containers and it solved the problem. It may seem obvious now, but it was a pretty hard one to debug. I also tried to blacklist virtual interfaces in the network manager so the changes triggered by healthcheck virtual interfaces are not propagated up, but this ended up not working reliably. It may be worth exploring this approach further as it seems cleaner (and more nuclear) but the time I time-boxed for this debugging was up and I had to move to something else. I guess this is good enough for now, I’ll keep you posted if this issue (or something related) ends up surfacing in the world again, or if I end up finding the time to debug and find a better fix for it.">

  <meta name="description" content="Before joining Protocol Labs as a Research Engineer, I worked as a blockchain expert at Telefónica R&amp;D, where I was responsible for the design and development of core technology based on blockchains, distributed systems, and advanced cryptography. My involvement in research and development began at Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, where I worked on topics related to energy efficiency in data centers. My R&amp;D experience also includes research into the compression efficiency of video coding standards at Ericsson Research and projects related to securing interdomain routing protocols at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. I am also an avid reader and basketball lover.">

<p>I have a lot of ideas, but I don&rsquo;t have the time to develop them. Financial independence would give me the ability to develop the ideas and research I share in this site and in my <a href="https://adlrocha.substack.com">newsletter</a>. If you see my ideas become a reality, become a sponsor of my work. Right now I am only accepting <a href="https://adlrocha.substack.com/subscribe">sponsors for my newsletter</a>, but this will change in the near future. I am also planning to post a public list of my patrons (they diserve part of the recognition for all my work).</p>
<h2 id="some-of-my-patrons">Some of my Patrons</h2>
<ul>
<li>Coming soon&hellip; I need to ask them permission to make them public first.</li>

# GoatCounter: Easy and open-source web analytics.
I was trying to find an analytics system that was open-source, that respected privacy as much as possible, and that was easy to set up. Suprisingly, I was able to find one after the first search without having to navigate several blog posts or Twitter threads with _"the best analytics tools you should really now about in 2023"_.

As their website states, [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/) _"is an open source web analytics platform available as a free donation-supported hosted service or self-hosted app. It aims to offer easy to use and meaningful privacy-friendly web analytics as an alternative to Google Analytics or Matomo."_

Setting it up in this same website has been as easy as signing up, and copying a `<script>` directive into the header of my site generator.

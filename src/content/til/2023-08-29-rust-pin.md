# When should one use Rust's `Pin<>`?
The other day I was reviewing some code from the [Fendermint](https://github.com/consensus-shipyard/fendermint) project that I am currently contributing to, and I had to ask the author of the PR directly, _"man! you have to teach me when I am supposed to use `Pin<>`. I see you are using it all over the place in this API, but I don't know why"_. His immediate answer was a bit surprising although kind of expected. He answered, _"I do compiler-driven development, so I don't have a good answer for you"_. It was kind of an expected answer because after some time writing code in Rust you get used to relying on the compiler for a lot of the heavy-lifting when writing more complex code in order to minimize your cognitive load.

However, after this immediate answer, he pointed me to an article from the `Tokio` team that did a great walk through of how, and why one, should use `Pin<Box<<>>` in certain cases when working with concurrent and asynchronous tasks. Let me directly link the publication here instead of paraphrasing in full. Enjoy!
